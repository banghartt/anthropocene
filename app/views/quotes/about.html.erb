  <h1>About ...</h1>
<p>
     Humanist Hub was built by <a href="http://thomasbanghart.getforge.io/">Thomas Banghart</a>. Thomas is a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Cruz studying anthropological archaeology. Although a fan of social theory, he believes it is best to approach it in bite sized pieces and made this site to help others find some interesting bits of someone else’s thinking.

    Thomas specializes in zooarchaeology, or the study of animal remains from archaeological sites. He has experience working with archaeofaunas from Canada, California, Texas, and eastern Africa. Currently, he is focused on studying seabird exploitation along the western shores of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. His research is part of an ongoing collaborative project between the University of Victoria, Parks Canada, and Tseshaht and Huu-ay-aht First Nation Communities titled the Historical-Ecology and Costal Archaeology of Barkley Sound. Since 2015, this interdisciplinary project has interwoven archaeological investigation, oral histories, and marine ecology to dissolve the boundaries between the social and natural sciences toward the conservation and restoration of natural and cultural heritage.
